# How to run the service

The first time when you run the service, you should create a folder, by default, MongoDB uses `/data/db`.Please note this might be different in newer versions of MongoDBã€‚To create the data folder, type and execute the following commands:
```
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown `id -u` /data/db
```
We changed ownership of the folder to my user instead of it being a root whatever it was before.Science proved that not having follders owned by root, reduces the number of permission denied errors by 100%.

# MongoDB console in detail

MongoDB console syntax is javascript. That's wonderful.

There are some most useful MongoDB console shell commands.

* help: print a list of avariable commands
* show dbs: prints the names of the databases on hte database server to which the conosle is connected(by default is localhost:27017), but if we pass params to `mongo`, we can connect to any remote instance
* use db_name: switch the `db_name`
* show collections: prints a list of collection in the selected database
* db.collection_name.find()
* db.collection_name.findOne()
* db.collection_name.insert(): saves document in the collection_name collection--a shorthand fo upsert(no _id) or insert (with _id)
* db.collection_name.update()
* db.collection_name.save()
* db.collection_name.remove()
* printjson(document)

For example:
~~~
var a = db.message.findOne()
printjson(a)
a.text = 'hi'
printjson(a)
db.message.save(a)
~~~

`save()`works two ways. To sum up, `save()` works like an upsert(update of insert).If you have the _id which is unique MongoDB ID, then the document will be updated with whatever new properties were passed to the `save()` method.That's the previous example in which I create a new property text and assigned a value of hi to it.

When there's no _id, then MongoDB console will insert a new document and create a new document ID.

Compass is a MongoDB desktop tool, download Compass at [https://mongodb.com/products/compass](https://mongodb.com/products/compass)

One more useful MongDB command is `mongoimport`.It allow developers to supply a json file that will be imported to a database. Let's say you are migrating a database of have some initial data that you want to use, but the database is empty.Right now.
~~~
mongoimport --db dbName --collection collectionName --file filenam.json --jsonArray
~~~
You don't need to do anything extra to install `mongoimport`.It's already part of the MongoDB installation and lives in the same folder as mongod or mongo,i.e., `bin`.
