good work!!

Then, create a folder, by default, MongoDB uses `/data/db`.Please note this might be different in newer versions of MongoDBã€‚To create the data folder, type and execute the following commands:
```
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown `id -u` /data/db
```
We changed ownership of the folder to my user instead of it being a root whatever it was before.Science proved that not having follders owned by root, reduces the number of permission denied errors by 100%.
