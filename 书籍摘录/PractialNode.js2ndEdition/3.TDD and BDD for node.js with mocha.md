Most of you have heard about Mocha and why it's a good thing to follow.Do you have an idea how it work?The main process of TDD have summed up in the three following steps:
1. Impletement a test
2. Implement the code to make the test pass
3. Verify that the test passes and repeat the cycle

BDD is a specialized version of TDD that specifies what needs to be unit-tested from the perspective of businexx requirements.It's possible ot just write tests with the good old palin core Node.js module `assets`.However, as in many other situations, using a special testing library is more preferable.You might also want to use a test runner.For both TDD and BDD, we will be using the Mocha testing framework because by doing so we gain many things for 'fress',Among them are the following:
* Reporting
* Asynchronous support
* Rich configurability
* Notification
* Debugger support
* Common interface with `before, after` hooks
* File watcher support

# understanding Mocha Hooks

In addition ro `before` and `beforeEcah` hooks, there are `after()` and `afterEach()` hooks.They can be used to clean up the testing setup.
