# install and understanding Mocha

Mocha is a mature and powful test framework for node.js.

npm i –g mocha@latest

Most of you have heard about Mocha and why it's a good thing to follow.Do you have an idea how it work?The main process of TDD have summed up in the three following steps:
1. Impletement a test
2. Implement the code to make the test pass
3. Verify that the test passes and repeat the cycle

BDD is a specialized version of TDD that specifies what needs to be unit-tested from the perspective of businexx requirements.It's possible ot just write tests with the good old palin core Node.js module `assets`.However, as in many other situations, using a special testing library is more preferable.You might also want to use a test runner.For both TDD and BDD, we will be using the Mocha testing framework because by doing so we gain many things for 'fress',Among them are the following:
* Reporting
* Asynchronous support
* Rich configurability
* Notification
* Debugger support
* Common interface with `before, after` hooks
* File watcher support

# understanding Mocha Hooks

In addition ro `before` and `beforeEcah` hooks, there are `after()` and `afterEach()` hooks.They can be used to clean up the testing setup.

All hooks support aysnchronous modes. The same is true for tests as well. For Example, the following test suite is synchronous and won't wait for the response to finish:
~~~js
describe('homepage', () => {
  it('should respond to GET', () => {
    superagent
      .get(`http://localhost:${port}`)
      .end((error, response) => {
        expect(response.status).to.equal(200)
      })
  })
})
~~~
But as soon as we add a `done` parameter to the test's function, our test case waits for the HTTP request to come back.We call `done()` to let Mocha know that 'Hey, you can move on, nothing else ot assert here.'If this `done()` is omitted, then the test will time out because no one will let the test runner/framework know about the finish
~~~js
describe('homepage', () => {
  it('should respond to GET', () => {
    superagent
      .get(`http://localhost:${port}`)
      .end((error, response) => {
        expect(response.status).to.equal(200)
        done()
      })
  })
})

# TDD with the Assert

# Chai assert

`chai` library that has assert module(and an `expect` module, and `should` module).Developers prefer to use chai assert over core assert because chai assert has more features.
~~~js
const assert = require('chai').assert

const {assert} = require('chai')
~~~

# BDD with Expect

Expect is one of the BDD languages.it's very polular because its yntax allows for chaining. It is richer in fetaures than core module `assert`.

~~~js
const expect = require('chai').expect
const {expect} = require('chai')
~~~

there is another library -- standalone `expect.js`(not 100% campatible with `chai.expect`)

~~~js
const expect = require('expect.js')
~~~

# write first BDD test for blog

~~~js
const boot = require('../app').boot
const shutdown = require('../app').shutdown
const port = require('../app').port
const superagent = require('superagent')
const expect = require('expect.js')

describe('server', () => {
  before(() => {
    // 启动server
    boot()
  })

  describe('homepage', () => {
    it('should respond to GET', (done) => {
      superagent
        .get(`http://localhost:${port}`)
        .end((error, response) => {
          expect(response.status).to.equal(200)
          done()
        })
    })
  })

  after(() => {
    // 关闭server
    shutdown()
  })
})
~~~

The test needs to start the server.Thus we expose those two methods, `boot` and `shutdown`.

~~~js
const server = http.createServer(app)
const boot = () => {
  server.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
    console.info(`Express server listening on port ${app.get('port')}`)
  })
}
const shutdown = () => {
  server.close()
}
if (require.main === module) {
  boot()
} else {
  console.info('Running app as a module')
  exports.boot = boot
  exports.shutdown = shutdown
  exports.port = app.get('port')
}
~~~

When a file is run directly from Node.js, `require.main` is set ot its `module`.That means that it is possible to determine whether a file has been run directly by testing `require.main === module`

For a file `foo.js`, this will be `true` if run via `node foo.js`, but `false` if run by `require('./foo')`

Because `module` provides a `filename` property(normally equivalent to `__filename`), the entry point of the current application can be obtained by checking `require.main.filename`

# putting configs into a Makefile

The `mocha` command accepts many, many, many options.It's often a good idea to have these options gathered in one place, whick could be a Makefile.For example, we cam have `test`, `test-w`, whick tests all files in the `test` folder, and have separate commands for just the `module-a.js` and 'module-b.js` files to test them separately. We can add any extra flags/options, such as reporter, timeout time, file watchingh, macOS grow notification, and so on.
