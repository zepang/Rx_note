# install and understanding Mocha

Mocha is a mature and powful test framework for node.js.

Most of you have heard about Mocha and why it's a good thing to follow.Do you have an idea how it work?The main process of TDD have summed up in the three following steps:
1. Impletement a test
2. Implement the code to make the test pass
3. Verify that the test passes and repeat the cycle

BDD is a specialized version of TDD that specifies what needs to be unit-tested from the perspective of businexx requirements.It's possible ot just write tests with the good old palin core Node.js module `assets`.However, as in many other situations, using a special testing library is more preferable.You might also want to use a test runner.For both TDD and BDD, we will be using the Mocha testing framework because by doing so we gain many things for 'fress',Among them are the following:
* Reporting
* Asynchronous support
* Rich configurability
* Notification
* Debugger support
* Common interface with `before, after` hooks
* File watcher support

# understanding Mocha Hooks

In addition ro `before` and `beforeEcah` hooks, there are `after()` and `afterEach()` hooks.They can be used to clean up the testing setup.

All hooks support aysnchronous modes. The same is true for tests as well. For Example, the following test suite is synchronous and won't wait for the response to finish:
~~~js
describe('homepage', () => {
  it('should respond to GET', () => {
    superagent
      .get(`http://localhost:${port}`)
      .end((error, response) => {
        expect(response.status).to.equal(200)
      })
  })
})
~~~
But as soon as we add a `done` parameter to the test's function, our test case waits for the HTTP request to come back.We call `done()` to let Mocha know that 'Hey, you can move on, nothing else ot assert here.'If this `done()` is omitted, then the test will time out because no one will let the test runner/framework know about the finish
~~~js
describe('homepage', () => {
  it('should respond to GET', () => {
    superagent
      .get(`http://localhost:${port}`)
      .end((error, response) => {
        expect(response.status).to.equal(200)
        done()
      })
  })
})

# TDD with the Assert

# Chai assert

`chai` library that has assert module(and an `expect` module, and `should` module).Developers prefer to use chai assert over core assert because chai assert has more features.

# BDD with Expect

Expect is one of the BDD languages.it's very polular because its yntax allows for chaining. It is richer in fetaures than core module `assert`.
