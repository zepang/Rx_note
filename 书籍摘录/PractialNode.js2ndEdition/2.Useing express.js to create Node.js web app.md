# What is Express.js ?

Express.js is a web framework base on core node.js http module and [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#readme) components. The components are called middlware are the cornerstones of the framework philosophy, which configuration over convention. In other words, Express.js system is highly configurable,which allow developers to freely pick whatever libraries they need for a particular project.For these reasons, the Express.js framework leads to flexibility and high customization in the development of web application.

If we write serious Node web apps using only core Node.js modules you most likely find yourself reinveting wheel by writing the same code continually over and over for similar boring mundane tasks, such as following:

* Parsing HTTP request bodies
* Parsing of cookie
* Getting information of URL
* Reading queryString data from URL and request body\
* Managing web session
* Organzing routes with a chain of if condition base on URL path and HTTP mehods of the request
* Determing proper response header base on data types

A good example is worth hundreds of words
