# What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a special communication 'channel' between browsers and servers.It's an HTML5 protocol.WebScoket's connection is constant, in contrast to traditional HTTP requests, which are always initiated by the client, which means there's no way for a server tonotify the client if there are updates.
