We can makes our apps and communications secure by using various aproaches, such as token-based authentication and/or OAuth([http://oauth.net](http://oauth.net)).We can leverage numerous third-party services(e.g.,Goole,Twitter,Github) or become service providers ourselves(e.g.,provide a publick API).

In this practical book, I dedicate the whole chapter to matters of authorization, authentication,OAuth, and best practices.
