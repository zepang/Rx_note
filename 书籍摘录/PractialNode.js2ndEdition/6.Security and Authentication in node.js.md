# 6.Security and Authentication in node.js

We can makes our apps and communications secure by using various aproaches, such as token-based authentication and/or OAuth([http://oauth.net](http://oauth.net)).We can leverage numerous third-party services(e.g.,Goole,Twitter,Github) or become service providers ourselves(e.g.,provide a publick API).

In this practical book, I dedicate the whole chapter to matters of authorization, authentication,OAuth, and best practices.

* Authorization with Express.js middleware
* Token-based authentication
* Session-based authentication
* Project: Adding email and password login to Blog
* Node.js: OAuth
* Project: Adding Twitter OAuth 1.0 sign-in with Everyauth([https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth))

# Authorization with Express.js Middleware

Express.js middleware allows to apply certain rules seamlessly to all routes, groups of routes (namespacing),or individual routes.
* All routes: `app.get('*', auth)`
* Groups of routes: `app.get('/api/*', auth)`
* Individual routes: `app.get('/admin/users', auth)`

Interestingly enough, `app.all()` with a URL pattern and an `*` is functionally the smae sa utilizing `app.use()` with a URL in a sense that they both will be triggered only on those URLs that are matching the URL pattern:
~~~js
app.use('/api', auth)
~~~
Another way of doing the smae thing is to use `auth` middleware on each route which requires it:
~~~js
app.get('/', home) // no Auth needed
app.get('/api/users', auth, users.list) // Auth needed
app.post('/api/users', auth, users.create) // Auth needed
~~~

In the prvious examples, `auth()` is a function with three parameters: `req`,`res`,`next`.
~~~js
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  // ...
  // Assuming you get user profile and user.auth is true or false
  if (user.auth) return next()
  else next(new Error('Not authorized')) // or res.send(401)
}
~~~

`next()` is invoked with an error object such as `next(new Error('Not authorized))`, then Express will jump straight to the first error handler, and none of the subsequent middleware or routes will be executed.

# Token-based Authentication

The most common authentication is cookie&session-based authentication, and the next section deals with this topic.
However, in some cases, more REST-fulness is required, or cookie/sessions are not supported well(e.g., mobile).In this case, it's beneficial to authenticate each request with a token(probably using the OAuth2.0 ([http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) scheme).The token can be passed in a query string or in HTTP request headers.Alternatively, we can send some other authentication combination of information, such as email/username and password, or API password, instead of a token.

In our example of token-based authentication, each request can submit a token in a query string(accessed via `req.query.token`).And if we have the correct value stored somewhere in our app(database, or in this example just a constant `SECRECT_TOKEN`),we can check the incoming token against it.If the token matches our records, we call `next()` to proceed with the request executions;if not, then we call `next(error)`, which triggers Express.js error handler execution(see the upcoming note).

~~~js
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.token && token === SECRECT_TOKEN) {
    return next()
  } else {
    return next(new Error('Not authorized'))// or res.send(401)
  }
}
~~~

We just covered the token-based authentication, which is often used in REST APIs.But user-facing web apps(i.e.,browser-enabled users & consumers) often use with cookies.We can use cookies to store and send seession IDs with each request.
