# Boosting Node.js and MongoDB with Mongoose

# DB connection in a standalone Mongoose script

const mongoose = require('mongoose)

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', {useMongoClient: true})
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise

# Mongoose shcema

These are the Mongoose data types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Buffer
* Date
* Array
* Schema.Types.ObjectId
* Schema.Types.Mixed

It's possible to create and use custom types that already have the rules for the ubiquitous email and URL types, e.g., there's a module [mongoose-types(http://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-types)](http://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-types)

Mongoose schemas are pluggable, which means, by creating a plugin,certain functionally can be extended across all schemas of the application.
