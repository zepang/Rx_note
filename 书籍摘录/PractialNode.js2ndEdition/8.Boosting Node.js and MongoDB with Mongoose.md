# Boosting Node.js and MongoDB with Mongoose

# DB connection in a standalone Mongoose script

~~~js
const mongoose = require('mongoose)

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', {useMongoClient: true})
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise
~~~

# Mongoose shcema

These are the Mongoose data types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Buffer
* Date
* Array
* Schema.Types.ObjectId
* Schema.Types.Mixed

It's possible to create and use custom types that already have the rules for the ubiquitous email and URL types, e.g., there's a module [mongoose-types(http://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-types)](http://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-types)

Mongoose schemas are pluggable, which means, by creating a plugin,certain functionally can be extended across all schemas of the application.

# Hooks for Keeping code organized

```js
bookSchema.pre('save', (next) => {
  // Upload pdf
  return next()
})
```

# custom static and instance methods

instance methods
```js
bookSchema.method({
  buy: function (quantity, customer, callback) {
    const bookTopPurchase = this
    return callback(results)
  }
})
```
static methods
```js
bookSchema.static({
  getZeroInventoryReport: function (callback) {
    return callback(books)
  }
})
```

Hooks and methods must be added to the schemas before compiling them to models --- in other words, before calling the `mongoose.model()` method.

# Mongoose Models

To compile a schema into a module

~~~js
const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema)
~~~

The first paramerter is just a string, which we can use latter to pull an instance of this model.Usually, this string is the same as the object literal for the model.It's usually capitalized, e.g.,`Book`.By default, Mongoose will use the model name to tie it to a collection name by pluralizing it.For example, the `Book` model will use books collection.

Nodeks are used to create documents.Document is the instance of the Model.

```js
const practicalNodeBook = new Book({name: 'Practical Node.js'})
```

# Relationships and Joins with population

Althrough, Node developers cannot query MongoDB on complex relationships, they can do so in the application layer with the help of Mongoose.

Let's say we have `posts` and `users` documents.User can write posts.There are two approches to implement this.We can use one collection.The `user` collection can have `posts` array field.This will require a single query, but this structure is limited in many ways because posts cannot be indexed or accessed separately from users.

Or we can use two collections.In this case, the structure is more flexible but requires at least two queries if we want to fetch a user and  his posts.

Don't fret.Mongoose is here to help.We can reference posts in the users schema and then populate the posts.In order to use `populate()`, we must define `ref` and the name of the model such as in the posts field of `userSchema`:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Shcema = mongoose.Schema

const userSchema = Schema({
  _id: Number,
  name: String,
  posts: [{
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Post'
  }]
})

const postSchema = Schema({
  _creator: { type: Number, ref: 'User' },
  title: String,
  text: String
})

// create two model and pull posts data with a single query.
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema)
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

User.findOne({ name: /azat/i })
  .populate('posts')
  .exec((err, user) => {
    if (err) return handleError(err)
    console.log('The user has % post(s)', user.posts.length)
  })
```
More usages:
```js
.populate({
  path: 'posts',
  // return only certain fields
  select: '_id, title, text',
  // filter the populated result
  match: { text: /node\.js/i },
  options: {
    limit: 10,
    sort: 'title'
  }
})
```

# Nested Documents
In the previous section, we saw how to populate a query on one collection with the data from another collection. That's a more tradtional approach to designing your database in the sense that it mimics relational database with its normal forms and strict atomization of data.

The document storage model in NoSQL databases is well suited to use nested documents.This is better whwen you know what queries are run most frequently.You can optimize your database to make it be biased to a certain query.For example, if we know that the most typical use case is to read user profiles, then instead of having two collections--`post` and `user` --we can have a single collection (`users`), with each item of that collection having `posts`.

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  posts: [mongoose.Schema.types.Mixed]
})

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)
```
However, the latter approach of using distinct new subschema is more flexible and powerful.
```js
const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  text: String
})
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  posts: [postSchema]
})
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)
```

# Virtual Fields 
Virtual fields are fields that don't exit in the database, but act just like regular fields in a mongoose document when accessed in a document.To oversimplify,virtual fields are mock or fake fields that pretend fo act lik an d be normal ones.

To define a virtual we need to do two things:
1. Call the `virtual(name)` method to create a virtual type[(Mongoose API)(http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#document-js)](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#document-js)

2. Apply a getter function `get(fn)` [(Mongoose API) (http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#virtualtype_VirtualType-get)](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#virtualtype_VirtualType-get).

~~~js
userSchema.virtual('fullname')
  .get(function () {
    return `${this.firstName}  ${this.lastName}`
  })
~~~

Another example is when only subset of the full document must be exposed and not the full details, as in the user model, which has tokes and passwords.Thus we omit fields that we want to hide by shitelisting only the fields we want to exposed, such as username and avatar, but not token, password, or salt:
```js
userSchema.virtual('info')
  .get(function () {
    return {
      service: this.service,
      username: this.username,
      name: this.name,
      date: this.date,
      url: this.url,
      avatar: this.avatar
    }
  })
```
