# boolean
```ts
let isDone: boolean = false
```
# number
```ts
let decimal: number = 6
let hex: number = 0xf00d
```
# string
```ts
let color: string = 'blue'
```
# array

```ts
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
```

```ts
let list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]
```

# Tuple

Tuple types allow you express an array where the type of fixed number of lements is known, but need not be the same.
```ts
let x: [string, number]
x = ['hello', 10] // ok
x = [10, 'hello'] // error
```

When accessing an element with a known index, the correct type is retrieved:
```ts
console.log(x[0].substr(1)); // OK
console.log(x[1].substr(1)); // Error, 'number' does not have 'substr'
```

When accessing an element outside the set of konwn indices, a union type is used instead (Union types are an advanced topic that weâ€™ll cover in a later chapter.):

```ts
x[3] = 'world'// ok
console.log(x[5].toString()) // ok
x[6] = false // error
```

# Enum

A helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from javaScript is the `enum`.

```ts
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
let c: Color = Color.green
```
Bydefault, enums befin numbering their members starting at 0.You can change this bu manually setting the value of one of its members.

```ts
enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}
let c: Color = Color.Green
```
Or, even manually set all the values in the enum
```ts
enum Color {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4}
let c: Color = Color.Green
```
A handy feature of enums is that you can also go from a numeric value to the name of that value in the enum.
```ts
enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}
let colorName: string = Color[2]

console.log(colorName) // Displays 'Green' as its value is 2 above
```

# Any

```ts
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure.ifItExists(); // okay, ifItExists might exist at runtime
notSure.toFixed(); // okay, toFixed exists (but the compiler doesn't check)

let prettySure: Object = 4;
prettySure.toFixed(); // Error: Property 'toFixed' doesn't exist on type 'Object'.

let list: any[] = [1, true, "free"];

list[1] = 100
```

# Void 
`void` is a little like the opposite of `any`: the absence of having any  type at all.You may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value:
```ts
function warnUse(): void {
  console.log('this is my waring message')
}
```
Declaring variables of type of `void` is not useful because only assign `undefined` or `null` to them
```ts
let unusable: void = undefined
```
# Null and Undefined
In TypeScript, both `undefined` and `null` actually have their own types named `undefined` ande `null` respectively.

```ts
let u: undefined = undefined
let n: null = null
```

# Never 
The `never` type represents the type of values that never occur.For instance, `never` is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns;Variables also acquire the type `never` when narrowed by any type guards that can never be true.

```ts
function error(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message)
}
function fail () {
  return error('something failed')
}
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while(true) {}
}
```

# Object
`object` is a type that represents the non-primitive type, i.e. any thing that is not `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`
```ts
declare function create(o: object | null): void

create({ prop: 0 }); // OK
create(null); // OK

create(42); // Error
create("string"); // Error
create(false); // Error
create(undefined); // Error
```
